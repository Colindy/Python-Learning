I promise to always have your back, no matter what we're facing.
I promise to always ride with you in life, even when we have to go through Illinois to get to Massachusettes.
I promise to always be the glass half full, to fill you up when you feel like your glass is half empty.
I promise to always be your puzzle piece, because I know you'll always be there to be mine.
